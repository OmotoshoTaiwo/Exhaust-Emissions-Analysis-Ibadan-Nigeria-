## 🔬 Project Summary

This project presents a data-driven environmental study analyzing **exhaust emissions from industrial generators** across strategic locations in **Ibadan, Nigeria**. Leveraging **Python**, **GIS mapping**, and **regression modeling**, this research reveals the pollutant distribution (CO, CO₂, HC, O₂, and NOx) across major industrial zones — providing insight into **air quality trends** and potential environmental impacts.

This work is a fusion of **environmental science** and **data analytics** — a strong example of how data can power **sustainability decisions**.

## 📍 Study Area

Ibadan is a major urban city in Southwest Nigeria, home to vibrant industrial activity. Emissions were measured from selected organizations and generator-powered industries across:

- Tollgate Area  
- Oluyole Industrial Estate  
- Soka Axis  
- Ibadan-Lagos Expressway

---

## ⚙️ Methodology & Tools

**🔧 Data Collection:**  
A KANE Automotive 5-Gas Analyzer was used to measure:
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)
- Hydrocarbons (HC in ppm)
- Oxygen (O₂)
- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx in ppm)

**🧪 Sampling Conditions:**  
- Conducted in June 2023 (rainy season)
- Each measurement lasted 10 minutes while generators were “on load”
- All generators were tested in triplicate to ensure reliability

**📈 Data Analysis:**  
- Python 3.9.12  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `geopandas`, `QGIS`, `ArcGIS`

**📊 Statistical & Visual Techniques:**  
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, IQR, outliers)
- Pair plot of numerical features  
- Correlation heatmap & regression models  
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  
- Duncan Multiple Range Test  
- Spatial distribution maps using GIS
